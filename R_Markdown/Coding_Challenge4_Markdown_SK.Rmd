# Coding Challenge 4 - Markdown

## **Manuscript Reference**
[Noel, Z.A., Roze, L.V., Breunig, M., Trail, F. 2022. *Endophytic fungi as promising biocontrol agent to protect wheat from Fusarium graminearum head blight*. Plant Disease.](https://doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1253-RE)

## **1. Explain the Following**

### a. YAML Header
A **YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) header** in R Markdown is a section at the top of the file enclosed by triple dashes (`---`). It defines metadata for the document, such as the title, author, date, and output format.

### b. Literate Programming
Literate programming means **writing programs as documents**, where explanations guide the reader, and code is embedded seamlessly. **R Markdown is a perfect example of literate programming!**

## **2. Data Preparation**
### **Read the Data**
The dataset is loaded using a **relative file path**, ensuring portability. Missing values (`NA`) are explicitly defined.

```{r load_data, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)

# Read the data using a relative path
data <- read.csv("R_Markdown/MycotoxinData.csv", na.strings = "na")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)
