## R Markdown for Iterative Programming

R Markdown is a powerful tool for iterating and refining programs, integrating code, output, and documentation in one document. It supports multiple languages, facilitates collaboration, and enables dynamic reports in formats like HTML, PDF, and Word.
And it is a great tool for reproduciblity.

### R Markdown and Code Chunck

To include R code in your Rmarkdwon document, you will need to insert a code chunk.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
library(markdown)
```


This is an example of R code:
"Include" option shows the code chunk
"Echo" option shows the output
```{r r_code_example, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars)
```

```{r Include figures}
data("mtcars")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(color = wt)) +
  xlab("Weight") + 
  ylab("Miles per gallon") +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "forestgreen", high = "black")
```
You can also R Markdown Formatting Options to organize your documents:

### Headers:

# First level header
## secod level header
### Third level header
#### Forth level header

### Italics (by putting the sentence between `* *`):

`*This text is in italics*`

### Bold (by putting the sentence between `** **` or `__ __`):

`**This text is in bold**`
`__This text is also in bold__`

### List of items (by putting the - or numbers on the left side of the items name):

- Item one
- Item two
 - Subitem two
 
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item

### Links (by putting the [ ] on both sides of the sentence):
[Link to my github](https://github.com/szk0263/PLPA6820_SK)

### Images (by putting the ![ ] on both sides of the image name following by the image path in paranthesis):

![Shrek ggplot](shrek.jpg)

If you forgot the exclamation mark (!), it will become just a link

### Formatted tables:
```{r}
kable(head(mtcars, n = 5), digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```

## Organizing a repository and editing a readme using Markdown
### Directory Tree
We can also create a file tree using the fs package in R. This package allows us to print the directory structure, which is useful for providing explicit instructions in the README about each file's purpose. We can copy the file tree text and paste it into a markdown block to make it viewable on GitHub. Labeling the file tree and providing descriptions for each file helps users understand the project structure.

First install the package "fs"
Then run this code:
```{r}
fs::dir_tree()
```
### Zenodo Link
Additionally, we can create a Zenodo badge for our repository. Zenodo provides a DOI (digital object identifier) that links back to your work, making it citable. To do this, you need a Zenodo account linked to your GitHub account. Once linked, you can create a release on GitHub, which Zenodo will recognize and generate a badge for. This badge can be included in your README, providing a direct link to the release.
